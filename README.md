# spotify-clone
This project is my take on a spotify clone, using PHP, HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript.

To view this project, you will need to download XAMPP, add all of these files into a single folder and add this new folder into the 'htdocs' folder that already exists in XAMPP.

Then go to your browser and type localhost/yourNewFolder
